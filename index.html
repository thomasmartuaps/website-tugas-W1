                    <h3>Geography and Climate</h3>
                    <p>Jakarta is located at the mouth of the Ciliwung Riveron Jakarta Bay on the northwest coast of Java, which is by an inlet of the Java Sea. The northern part of Jakarta is flat alluvial plains. Some areas are below sea level and subject to flooding while the south of Jakarta is my hilly and less prone to flooding. Jakarta is also sinking nearly 17 cm (6.7 inches) each year, which has worsened flooding in the area. This has caused the national government to consider moving the Indonesian capital to a different city.</p>
